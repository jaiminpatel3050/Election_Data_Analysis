# Election_Data_Analysis
In this portfolio project, I looked at the data from the 2012 elections and tried to find out what was the party affiliation, who was being polled out, how undecided voters affect the poll, how did voter sentiment vary over time. In this Election Data Project, I covered two datasets, one is political polls and the second is Donors data.
